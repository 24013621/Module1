# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

##  Program

```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=int(input())
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```

## Output
<img width="727" height="289" alt="544455710-6f69542d-e36f-43ee-90c9-aa07b6932f2e" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c9b143-7dc2-41d2-8ff0-a913aa6806d2" />

## Result

Thus the python program to get the input from the user and print it executed successfully.

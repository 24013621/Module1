# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

##  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

##  Program
```
v = 'T'
w = "a"
print(v)
print(w)
```
## Output

<img width="1052" height="373" alt="544454459-1e96254e-a534-4d4c-8a36-61b4583831e9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd6a8b27-a7fa-45a7-a6f2-2c8849e1c693" />


## Result
Thus the python program to print the character literal is executed successfully.
